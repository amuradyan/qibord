# Notes

Moved around the keys on the lowest row. Some movements on `v1.0` are too hard and quite straining, when it comes to picking _special_ combinations like **CTRL**, **MOD** or **ALT**, etc.

The layer layouts are mostly convenient thou. Some symbols need to moved on the same layer, a few need to move another layer altogether. For example the `=` was moved from the numpad layer to the default layer. The numpad layer itself was shifted one key to the right to enable a safe zone on the left of it, between the control keys and the numbers.

I've already modified am using a new layout, what I think can be `v1.1`.
