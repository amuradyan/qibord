# Notes

I updated the layout of the qibord and flashed the firmware and it works just fine. In fact, this note is typed using the `qibord`. It is very unusual and I am really slow yet, but I already feel how comfortable this can be once I get used to it. I need more practice.

It turns out my custom layout ruined my armenian and russian layout.
