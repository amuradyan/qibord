# Notes

I did the soldering today. Turns out it not so hard to pick up. When cutting the excess legs after soldering, I accidentally picked off a 0.1uF capacitor and now my left _2U_ key, i.e. my **SPACEBAR** is not working. The rest is fine.

I was able to create and flash a custom layout firmware using the [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) and their [web config page](https://config.qmk.fm/#/keebio/nyquist/rev3/LAYOUT_ortho_5x12).

Now, there are two things I can do:

1. I can remap my spacebar to the right _2U_ key on one of the layouts. This will cause some trouble, but not as much so to ruin the experience completely. I'll still get to test the _qibord_.

2. I can buy the capacitor and try to put it back. This worries me since I can fuck up the whole plate. I know a guy who knows a guy who is a field expert. I will consult with him.

If I blow the plate or really feel that the misplaced spacebar ruins it for me at some point, I'll just buy a new Nyquist set and use the left half of it.

Here is how it looks:
