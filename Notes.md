# Notes

## General notes

It would be nice to have a split keyboard, a TKL one would suffice.

It would be nice to have MOD keys, kind of like in vim. I think they should be on the right half. One such use of a mod key is to transition to NUMPAD mode, that, I think will be situated on the right half.

The CAPSLOCK key is not needed

Another thing I noticed is I almost never use the right shift key on my current (full)keyboards.

I, J, K, L keys on the right half can be used to simulate arrow keys via a mod key.

MOD keys can be sticky and not-sticky.

## Hardware

[KBO-5000](https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/kbo-5000-split-staggered-80-keyboard) 80% keyboard seems to be a nice place to start.

[BFO-9000](https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/bfo-9000-keyboard-customizable-full-size-split-ortholinear) is another option but I do not see how to assemble it yet.
